# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical indexing errors and robustness issues in the multi-GPU cuVS (CUDA Vector Search) scaling implementation. The current implementation fails with "index 2 is out of bounds for axis 0 with size 2" errors when attempting to perform vector searches across multiple GPUs, indicating improper GPU index management and array bounds checking.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher running multi-GPU vector search experiments, I want the cuVS implementation to properly handle GPU indexing, so that I can successfully run scaling tests without encountering out-of-bounds errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system detects available GPUs THEN it SHALL correctly map GPU indices to available hardware without exceeding bounds
2. WHEN distributing embeddings across GPUs THEN the system SHALL ensure consistent indexing between embedding parts and GPU assignments
3. WHEN performing searches across multiple GPUs THEN the system SHALL only access GPU indices that correspond to available hardware
4. IF a GPU index is requested that exceeds available hardware THEN the system SHALL raise a clear error message indicating the mismatch

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer debugging multi-GPU implementations, I want comprehensive error handling and validation, so that I can quickly identify and resolve configuration issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing multi-GPU operations THEN the system SHALL validate that embedding distribution matches available GPU count
2. WHEN building indices on GPUs THEN the system SHALL verify each GPU assignment before attempting operations
3. IF embedding parts exceed available GPUs THEN the system SHALL either redistribute or provide clear error messaging
4. WHEN errors occur during GPU operations THEN the system SHALL provide specific details about which GPU and operation failed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a researcher conducting scaling experiments, I want robust memory management across multiple GPUs, so that I can run large-scale tests without memory leaks or corruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cleaning up GPU resources THEN the system SHALL properly deallocate memory on all used GPUs
2. WHEN switching between different vector sizes THEN the system SHALL clear previous GPU allocations completely
3. IF memory allocation fails on any GPU THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the failure and clean up partial allocations
4. WHEN the test completes THEN all GPU memory SHALL be properly released

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user running vector search operations, I want consistent and accurate search results across multiple GPUs, so that the distributed implementation produces reliable outputs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN merging search results from multiple GPUs THEN the system SHALL correctly combine and rank all results
2. WHEN converting between device arrays and host arrays THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity
3. IF search results are empty from any GPU THEN the system SHALL handle the case gracefully without crashing
4. WHEN performing global top-k selection THEN the system SHALL accurately sort and select the best results across all GPUs

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator deploying multi-GPU applications, I want the system to gracefully handle varying GPU configurations, so that the same code works across different hardware setups.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL automatically detect and adapt to the available GPU count
2. IF fewer GPUs are available than expected THEN the system SHALL redistribute workload accordingly
3. WHEN GPU availability changes during runtime THEN the system SHALL detect and handle the change appropriately
4. IF no GPUs are available THEN the system SHALL fall back to CPU processing with appropriate warnings
