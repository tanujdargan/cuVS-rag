Specifically, poverty, lack of insurance coverage, large household sizes, and social vulnerability are all factors implicated in incidence and mortality rates of infectious disease. However, no studies have examined the relationship of these factors to the COVID-19 pandemic on a state-wide level in Florida. Thereby, the objective of this study is to examine the relationship between average household size, poverty, uninsured populations, social vulnerability index (SVI), and rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Florida counties. The objective was accomplished by analyzing the cumulative case and death reports from state and local health departments in Florida. The data was compiled into a single dataset by the CDC COVID-19 Task Force. Using US Census Bureau data, all Florida counties were classified into tertiles of the separate categories of poverty rate, average household size, uninsured rates, and SVI (Social Vulnerability Index). The poverty level was classified as low (0-12.3%), moderate (12.3-17.3%), and high (>17.3% below the federal poverty line). The uninsured population proportion was classified as low (0-7.1%), moderate (7.1-11.4%), and high (>11.4% uninsured residents). Average county household size was classified as low (0-2.4), moderate (2.4-2.6), and high (>2.6). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)/Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) used US census data on 15 social determinants of vulnerability to evaluate and assist disadvantaged communities. SVI tertiles were low (0-0.333), moderate (0.334-0.666), and high (0.667-1) on a range of 0-1, with higher numbers signifying communities with many factors of social vulnerability. The mean cumulative cases and deaths per 100,000 inhabitants were calculated in each tertile for each category. Analysis of the data revealed that case and mortality rates due to COVID-19 in the high poverty counties were markedly higher in Florida than the national average. In contrast, moderate and low poverty rates were below average. Similarly, counties with a high SVI had case and mortality rates greatly above state and national averages. Counties with a high proportion of uninsured displayed the highest case rates. However, mortality rates were the highest in counties with a low proportion of uninsured individuals. No clear correlation was observed between COVID-19 rates and household size. It was concluded that compiled CDC and US census data suggests a significant correlation between poverty, social vulnerability, lack of insurance coverage, and increased incidence and mortality from COVID-19. Future research should statistically analyze the correlations and examine the individual factors of SVI as potential COVID-19 predictors.", "output": "Socioeconomic Determinants of COVID-19 Incidence and Mortality in Florida"}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "How does Tiagabine exert its effects as an anti-epileptic?", "output": "Tiagabine exerts its effects as an anti-epileptic by inhibiting GABA reuptake."}, {"instruction": "If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.", "input": "L23 L34 L45 L5S1 herniations. all with nerve root contact except for L5.

Objective: To identify and address the career development, work culture, and childcare needs of faculty, staff, and trainees at an academic medical center during a pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: For this survey study, between August 5 and August 20, 2020, a Qualtrics survey was emailed to all faculty, staff, and trainees at University of Utah Health, an academic health care system that includes multiple hospitals, community clinics, and specialty centers. Participants included 27\u00e2\u0080\u00af700 University of Utah Health faculty, staff, and trainees who received a survey invitation. Data analysis was performed from August to November 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes included experiences of COVID-19 and their associations with career development, work culture, and childcare needs. Results: A total of 5030 participants completed the entire survey (mean [SD] age, 40 [12] years); 3738 (75%) were women; 4306 (86%) were White or European American; 561 (11%) were Latino or Latina (of any race), Black or African American, American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander; and 301 (6%) were Asian or Asian American. Of the participants, 2545 (51%) reported having clinical responsibilities, 2412 (48%) had at least 1 child aged 18 years or younger, 3316 (66%) were staff, 791 (16%) were faculty, and 640 (13%) were trainees. Nearly one-half of parents reported that parenting (1148 participants [49%]) and managing virtual education for children (1171 participants [50%]) were stressors. Across all participants, 1061 (21%) considered leaving the workforce, and 1505 (30%) considered reducing hours. Four hundred forty-nine faculty (55%) and 397 trainees (60%) perceived decreased productivity, and 2334 participants (47%) were worried about COVID-19 impacting their career development, with 421 trainees (64%) being highly concerned. Conclusions and Relevance: In this survey of 5030 faculty, staff, and trainees of a US health system, many participants with caregiving responsibilities, particularly women, faculty, trainees, and (in a subset of cases) those from racial/ethnic groups that underrepresented in medicine, considered leaving the workforce or reducing hours and were worried about their career development related to the pandemic.

The main objective of this study was to gain a better insight into the main management characteristics of the actors in the sector. It was assumed that more efficient management of financial investments (acquisitions, loans) caused higher risk financial investment decisions in the pharmaceutical industry in order to place companies in a better position in view of equity investors, illustrated best as the profitability of equity (ROE). This paper examined one possible means of covering the extremely high indirect costs (R&D, marketing) of pharmaceutical companies, also justified by the restructuring of the industry and the effect of investments in long term financial instruments on the ROE of the same business entities. Built on the EMIS database, the analysis only used the indicators of those companies operating in the pharmaceutical industry in Visegrad countries for 2019. The authors sought to draw conclusions about possible management characteristics of the entire pharmaceutical sector of these countries using cluster analysis and linear regression. The initial assumption, or main hypothesis of the study, was that in one of the countries studied or for those businesses operating above a certain revenue category, the impact of a company\u2019s risk-taking (which can also be expressed in terms of asset-based financial income) on profitability, may appear or intensify. The performed studies did not show a strong correlation between the explanatory and profit variables either at the national level or at the level of groups formed by regional market position. In other words, the extremely high level of indirect costs were mostly covered by sales of successful cash products, and companies not indebted to suppliers undertook significant risks in the field of financial investments, thereby offsetting the positive impact of the latter on earnings.", "output": "The Effect of Financial Risk Taking on Profitability in the Pharmaceutical Industry"}, {"instruction": "Answer this question truthfully", "input": "Hi doctor,My son has storage pool defect.

METHODS: A prospective cohort study including consecutive kidney transplant recipients in a single referral transplant center. Participants were tested for anti-spike (anti-S) antibodies 2-4 weeks following second vaccine dose. Primary outcome was rate of seropositivity. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with seropositivity. RESULTS: Of 308 kidney transplant recipients included, only 112 (36.4%) tested positive for anti-S antibodies 2-4 weeks after receiving the second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine. Median antibody titer was 15.5 AU/mL (interquartile range [IQR] 3.5-163.6). Factors associated with antibody response were higher estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (odds ratio [OR] 1.025 per ml/min/1.73m(2), 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.014 - 1.037, p<0.001), lower mycophenolic acid dose (OR 2.347 per 360 mg decrease, 95% CI 1.782 - 3.089, p<0.001), younger age (OR 1.032 per year decrease, 95% CI 1.015 - 1.05, p<0.001) and lower calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) blood level (OR 1.987, 95% CI 1.146 - 3.443, p=0.014).

As his wife, I am beside myself  I am a post concussion trauma patient and my doctors have said I need to leave all this stress. He is always fussy, or angry or rageous over nothing in particular. I just want to find a doctor who is understanding and not accusatory.  WE need to find out if he may be bipolar, or have some sort of mental disorder that has been brought on by all the stress.  Dr. Mary Hill is my neuropsychogist and she recommended a woman, when my husband called, they said he had to see a counselor first.

MHV replication and transcription take place via the synthesis of negative-strand RNA intermediates from a positive-strand genomic template. A cis-acting element previously identified in the 3' untranslated region binds to trans-acting host factors from mouse fibroblasts and forms at least three RNA-protein complexes. The largest RNA-protein complex formed by the cis-acting element and the lysate from uninfected mouse fibroblasts has a molecular weight of about 200 kDa. The complex observed in gel shift assays has been resolved by second-dimension sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis into four proteins of approximately 90, 70, 58, and 40 kDa after RNase treatment. Specific RNA affinity chromatography also has revealed the presence of a 90-kDa protein associated with RNA containing the cis-acting element bound to magnetic beads. The 90-kDa protein has been purified from uninfected mouse fibroblast crude lysates. Protein microsequencing identified the 90-kDa protein as mitochondrial aconitase. Antibody raised against purified mitochondrial aconitase recognizes the RNA-protein complex and the 90-kDa protein, which can be released from the complex by RNase digestion. Furthermore, UV cross-linking studies indicate that highly purified mitochondrial aconitase binds specifically to the MHV 3' protein-binding element. Increasing the intracellular level of mitochondrial aconitase by iron supplementation resulted in increased RNA-binding activity in cell extracts and increased virus production as well as viral protein synthesis at early hours of infection. These results are particularly interesting in terms of identification of an RNA target for mitochondrial aconitase, which has a cytoplasmic homolog, cytoplasmic aconitase, also known as iron regulatory protein 1, a well-recognized RNA-binding protein. The binding properties of mitochondrial aconitase and the functional relevance of RNA binding appear to parallel those of cytoplasmic aconitase.", "output": "Mitochondrial aconitase binds to the 3' untranslated region of the mouse hepatitis virus genome."}, {"instruction": "If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.", "input": "Is there any research that points to the use of Saw Palmetto as an anticoagulant for AF therapy?

This study aimed to understand video visit adoption by plastic surgery providers; and patient and surgeon perceptions about its efficacy, value, accessibility, and long-term viability. A secondary aim was to develop the proposed 'Triage Tool for Video Visits in Plastic Surgery' to help determine visit video eligibility. METHODS: This mixed-methods evaluation assessed provider-level scheduling data from the Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Stanford Health Care to quantify telemedicine adoption and semi-structured phone interviews with patients (n = 20) and surgeons (n = 10) to explore stakeholder perspectives on video visits. RESULTS: During the 13-week period after the local stay-at-home orders due to coronavirus disease 2019, 21.4% of preoperative visits and 45.5% of postoperative visits were performed via video. Video visits were considered acceptable by patients and surgeons in plastic surgery in terms of quality of care but were limited by the inability to perform a physical examination. Interviewed clinicians reported that long-term viability needs to be centered around technology (eg, connection, video quality, etc) and physical examinations. Our findings informed a proposed triage tool to determine the appropriateness of video visits for individual patients that incorporates visit type, anesthesia, case, surgeon's role, and patient characteristics. CONCLUSION: Video technology has the potential to facilitate and improve preoperative and postoperative patient care in plastic surgery but the following components are needed: patient education on taking high-quality photos; standardized clinical guidelines for conducting video visits; and an algorithm-assisted triage tool to support scheduling.", "output": "Patient and surgeon experiences with video visits in plastic surgery-toward a data-informed scheduling triage tool"}, {"instruction": "If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.", "input": "Hi, Im 22 and I suffer from constant lower back pain.

Further, the Privacy Attitudes Questionnaire assessed respondents' general privacy boundaries. The results suggest that respondents supported using wastewater for health monitoring, but within some bounds. Participants were most likely to support or strongly support monitoring for disease (95%), environmental toxins (94%), and terroristic threats (90%, e.g., anthrax). Two-thirds of respondents endorsed no prohibition to locations being monitored while the most common category of location respondents wanted to be prohibited from monitoring was personal residencies.

METHODS: Two hundred and 20 consecutive patients were evaluated at 3\u20136 months after discharge with high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and categorized as recovered (REC) or not recovered (NOT-REC). Both HRCTs at hospitalization (HRCT(0)), when available, and HRCT(1) during follow-up were analyzed semiquantitatively as follows: ground-glass opacities (alveolar score, AS), consolidations (CONS), and reticulations (interstitial score, IS). RESULTS: A total of 175/220 (80%) patients showed disease resolution at their initial radiological evaluation following discharge. NOT-REC patients (45/220; 20%) were mostly older men [66 (35\u201385) years vs. 56 (19\u201387); p = 0.03] with a longer in-hospital stay [16 (0\u201375) vs. 8 (1\u201352) days; p < 0.0001], and lower P/F at admission [233 (40\u2013424) vs. 318 (33\u2013543); p = 0.04]. Moreover, NOT-REC patients presented, at hospital admission, higher ALV [14 (0.0\u201362.0) vs. 4.4 (0.0\u201344.0); p = 0.0005], CONS [1.9 (0.0\u201326.0) vs. 0.4 (0.0\u201318.0); p = 0.0064], and IS [11.5 (0.0\u2013 29.0) vs. 0.0 (0.0\u201322.0); p < 0.0001] compared to REC patients.

I have had migraine headaches for years and when the pungent smell lingers for too long it triggers my migraine. Every day for two-weeks now, I would wake up with a runny nose and sneezing for the first 30-45 mins. When I get out to go to school or at work, I sometime smell a faint urine smell as well, it reoccurs outside of home. This have led me to searching online", "output": "hello, you need to consult a neurologist to ensure that the migraine attacks are not as frequent as you think. there are several types of migraine, or worse case scenario he would ask you to get a sleep-deprived eeg done to ensure there are no abnormalities with an mri backup. allergy tests are certainly required, specific ige blood test against aeroallergens including molds to ensure that the rhinitis bit is figured out. long acting antihistamines with nasal sprays will help. cinnarizine is an antihistamine that combined with paracetamol and risperidone has anti-migraine effects, so may be worth trying. best wishes."}, {"instruction": "If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.", "input": "Dear sirs, I have a baby boy of 04(four) months old. Some white soft things are seeing during he pee. He has fever also. An antibiotic zithiumO & crocin is prescribed by the physician. Is this antibiotic is correct for such type of UTI ? please reply at the earliest.", "output": "hi. thank you for posting your question. the diagnosis of uti (urinary tract infection) in any child especially a 4-month-old should not be based on merely the presence of whitish discharge in urine and fever. it should be confirmed by getting a urine culture done and only then appropriate treatment initiated. even if uti has been confirmed, azithromycin (lithium o) is not the chatbot.  also, uti in a 4-month-old child needs to be investigated further in lines of any structural abnormality of the urinary tract. this is usually done by an ultrasound scan, a maturating cystourethrography and a dms renal scan. however, your first approach should be to confirm whether it is the uti that is causing this fever. in the meantime keeping his fever under control by cronin"}]
